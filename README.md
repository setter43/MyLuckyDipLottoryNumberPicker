My Lucky Dip Lottory Number Picker

Whenever I decided to play the lottery I would choose a "lucky dip" however I would find more often then not I would get 3 numbers in sequence of each other. While this is still a possible draw. The total times 3 numbers in sequence have been drawn was less frequent. I didn't fancy my chance with the numbers which weere getting picked for me, so i decided to build a web app which would pick my numbers for me using my own method of madness.

Feel free to use this your self!

The app is designed around the UK national lottery 5 numbers 1-50 and 2 luck stars 1-12.

Rules for 5 numbers:
  Numbers can not be the same
  Numbers can not be in sequence of each other (A range of 1 or -1)
  
 Rules for Lucky Stars
  The numbers can not be the same

Simply just click the button to generate numbers, click again for another set of numbers.
